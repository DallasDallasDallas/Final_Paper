  <br> <bold> Skyrim: </bold></br>
  <br> <bold> Note #1:  </bold></br>
 In the world of <bold><italics>  Skyrim </italics> </bold> the player is often hailed <bold>(Note #1)</bold> as talked about in, <italics> “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses.” </italics> Both explicitly and implicitly the game gameplay invites us into its world. When playing you may come upon orcs, of which, will hail you the player. Saying that, “you are in this world and are the representation of enemy therefore I will fight you.” Or in other ways you may find yourself speaking to a trader who speaks to you in the way you exist in the world; not by your real living name.” In the world you will hear people speak in dialogue which suggests that you had to have found yourself there at that very moment to hear it. The player is invited to exist in the space as if they themselves were the actual character which represents in some part them. You may find yourself being persecuted for something which you have done. Again, you must align with the “big Other” as it exists in the world. You may join a clan or brotherhood in which you will further define your alignment with more intricate parts of the world. Where decisions you make must then be in alignment with the deeper space you’ve created as you define yourself in the world. Now exists outcomes which are predicated on your positioning in the space. You may be like by a group and hated by another. Further the process of reinforcement presents the solidification in your being as defined by the <bold>“State Apparatuses.”</bold>

  <br> <bold> Note #2:  </bold></br>
 Another aspect which is present when playing the game of <bold> <italics> Skyrim </italics> </bold> is the idea of playing games as a survival instinct, to expel energy, or rehearse for the future. <bold> (Note #2)  </bold> In the symbolic nature of the game or gaming in general there exists a like understanding of implications and assortment of play as they relate to the real world. In the game you see many things which exists as symbols and things which don’t exists at all. Many things exist in the realm of magic, potion, and old lore as exists in some participation with existent culture. Maybe very less explicitly does the game prepare the player for future events more so it does in allow the player to master the intrinsic idea of survival. Maybe in some way the game elicits those deep-rooted humans’ instincts which are long suppressed by smart ovens and the McDonalds drive-thru. For a moment when playing the player gets to engage at a level, in the game simplification, beyond the bounds of possibility of the actual world. The player regardless of actual life circumstance or ability can gain a mastery sufficient to their joy and exceed at expelling energy. The game is a space of existence in which what matters is the will of the player, entirely, as it exists in the confines of that world. Here you are the master of survival. You can rehearse for the future in a way by your ability to think more abstractly about a relative circumstance in real life. Though, sword fights might not be a cause of concern for most. Though that ability of abstraction may help you solve a real-life puzzle as you have in the game. Though, ultimately the game allows you to expel energy to live in someway exactly how you would like to albeit a fantasy world.

  <br> <bold> Note #3:  </bold></br>
 One aspect of the game which I think is important is the use of music and its combination with the world of gameplay as it relates to “The Simulacrum”. (Note #3) In the world of <bold> <italics> Skyrim </italics> </bold> One of the most important features is that of sound design and soundtrack. As presented in the song contained in this site the music of the game is powerful and emotional. I would argue that the combination of the music with the gameplay can make some moments when playing deeply connected to the player. The world as it relates as a “copy” of actuality can make the gameplay more rewarding as the player can draw deeper connection the real world. As to say someone might have less of a connection to a game like that of PONG. So, in moments the game can feel “real” and “even more real” as the player is deeply connected to it through the combination of gameplay and effective music.
