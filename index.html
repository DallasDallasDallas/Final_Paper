  <br>Skyrim: </br>
  Mainly, In this site I want to talk about the "Reality Effect" and it's importance in the world of Skyrim. In the game you are the Dragon Born.
  A person, in whichever way you have designed, born of rare attributes as a person. You are capable of fighting any and everyone in the game. 
  As the name suggests as a Dragon Born you consume the souls of, well, Dragon's and have the ability to use many abilites uncommon to the people. 
  The game, firstly, is impactful in its musical score. One which I find myself using sometimes to sleep at night. That's besides the point.
  The main point is the gravity of the sound track. You are further engaged into the world when you hear the wispering of orchestral instruments.
  You may find yourself walking into some unknown part of a forest and are invited to think more in the realm of calm as the blissful ambiance plays.
  Then in the next instant there is orcs rallying to take you out, the Dragon Born. You in that instant, as the come forth, use your Fus-ro-dah the 
  Dragon Born force of gushing wind. As a player you feel it the deep flow of wind flinging the enemy through the trees. As you fight you feel the impact
  of your swords as you down one after the other. A potion may be used and then as they all fall to your blade a deep fleeting sound plays as you have 
  discovered a new location. The game puts you again at ease as you feel the rush of new loot and a new cave to venture into.
